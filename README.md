Github wont allow me to bring in my dataset folder and model because it exceeds the limit memory, I uploaded a jpg of my streamlit app on my local machine. I didnt get the chance to display the test dataset on the model because of time limit, but doing it on the console real quick gave good results. The jpg just shows one test case.
